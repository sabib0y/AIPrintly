# Wake — Get Up to Speed

Read the tracking documentation and provide a concise briefing on where we left off and what's next.

## Files to Read

Read these files in `planning/phase1/`:

1. **`progress-log.md`** — Check the most recent entry (at the top) to see what was done last
2. **`10-roadmap.md`** — Check current workstream progress and wave status
3. **Optional: `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`** — If exists at project root, check for recent decisions

## Briefing Format

Provide a concise briefing with:

### Last Session
- Date and title of last progress log entry
- Brief summary of what was accomplished

### Current Status
- Which workstream(s) are active (A: Assets, B: Builder, C: Commerce, D: Fulfilment, E: Launch)
- Overall progress percentage
- Any blockers or deferred items noted

### Next Up
- Immediate pending tasks from the roadmap
- Any "Status" notes from the last progress log entry about what's next

### Quick Context
- Key files that were recently modified (if relevant to continuing work)
- Any test counts or build status worth noting

## Guidelines

- Keep it brief — this is a quick catch-up, not a full report
- Focus on actionable information
- Highlight anything blocking or urgent
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- If the last entry mentions specific "next steps", surface those prominently

## Output Style

```
## Last Session: [Date] — [Title]
[1-2 sentence summary]

## Current Status
- Workstreams: A [%], B [%], C [%]
- Wave: [X] ([status])
- Progress: [X]%
- [Any blockers]

## Next Up
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Context
- [Any relevant notes about recent files, test status, etc.]
```

Keep the whole briefing under 20 lines where possible.
